# Stock Market Analysis and Portfolio Optimization

This project is a comprehensive pipeline for stock market analysis, predictive modeling, and portfolio optimization. It involves the following key steps:

`Data Collection:` Download stock market data for selected tickers using Yahoo Finance.

`Preprocessing:` Clean and preprocess the data to ensure consistency and accuracy.

`Feature Engineering:` Generate lag features, moving averages, and other derived metrics to enhance predictive power.

`Model Training:` Train predictive models like Linear Regression and ARIMA to forecast stock prices.

`Portfolio Optimization:` Use optimization techniques to create an efficient portfolio based on predicted stock returns.

`Evaluation:` Analyze model performance and evaluate the optimized portfolio using key metrics.

# Note

This project is still incomplete i wanted to make it unique so I mixed 2 things (1) Stock Market Analysis and (2) Portfolio Optimization

but in trying to do that I make it super complex and completely forgot the rule to make it simple and then iterate over time to improve 
I will start working on this soon and Finish it because learning is essential to me rather than making it with AI and submitting it. (Of course, I have used AI to build this )

So whoever will be reviewing this. Your feedback is very important to me. Give your honest feedback and suggestions on how to build it in your opinion 
## Thank You
